# CIRCUIT-SOLVER-2D-ANGULAR-GO

i took circuits at UF just for one semester, i am not a fan of instruction via powerpoint slides, id rather drink a bottle of casamigos

to master circuit solving i will create a circuit solver, way more stimulating than powerpoint sliding myself to death

i know ill just need basic math to start off but linear algebra, graph theory, diffeq to optimize the shit out of KCL, KVL, MNA

some people call it this and that but at the end of the day its just math
